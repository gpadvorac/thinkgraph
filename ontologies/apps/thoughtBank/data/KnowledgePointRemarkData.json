It allows users to borrow, trade and earn savings using its native Dai stablecoin, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one ratio. MakerDAO is reminiscent of a bank, as it issues loans secured by cryptocurrencies, but does not require documents, checks or good credit history. Users can pledge their savings in Ether (ETH), or in any of the 10 cryptocurrencies accepted by the platform, and receive a certain amount of Dai in return.\n\nOnce the loan has been taken out, the tokens can be spent on anything, although they are mostly used for investment. In order to return the loan, one needs to return the same amount of Dai that was earlier received, plus a little interest on top. If during this period, ETH price has increased, the user makes a profit, as the amount of the collateral in ETH increases in terms of its price in U.S. dollars.",
