For a lot of filmmakers right now, it's hard to step onto an XR stage due to the costs and limited access to the technology. It doesn't mean that filmmakers shouldn't pay attention to this emerging tool in cinema, however, as it unlocks a level of immersion that performers and directors could implement into their work, on set in real-time.  We're here to show you how it starts, from the LED wall to the lighting. In this video, we'll go over the gear being used to topics like image-based lighting and parallax camera movement.",

It became the rallying point of the entire Orthodox world against Moscow and the tiny church that Stalin had created.\"  \"Russians outside Russia saw the invasion of the USSR as a Godly movement, deeply imbued with the Holy Spirit. It was not merely the destruction of Stalin, but the victory of Hitler that these writers sought. ...

      "description": "I’VE DETAILED MANY TIMES on this program, and in articles on nationalvanguard.org, the facts that banking as we know it is the biggest fraud in the world — and a largely Jewish fraud — the whole basis of which is the creation of money out of nothing, and falsely calling such created money \"loans\" and demanding that consumers, workers, and taxpayers \"pay it back\" plus interest to the scamsters who created it from thin air in the first place.  You’d think that when running a fixed game like that, far more lucrative than even the ones their casino-mogul cousins and fellow Tribe members in Las Vegas operate, it would be very hard to fail. But, as we’ve seen with several major bank failures in just the last two weeks, the opposite is actually true. Failing this month we find Silicon Valley Bank, which served many wealthy clients and huge high tech players — Silvergate Bank, which was entangled with several \"exchanges\" which would be better called cryptocurrency casinos including Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX (remember, Bitcoin is not \"crypto\" — it is the opposite of \"crypto\") — and New York’s Signature Bank, which was once famously Donald Trump’s \"go to bank\" for many of his deals but dumped him after the January 6 fiasco, which catered mainly to New York City’s financial elite, and which also was intertwined with innumerable \"crypto\" scams and \"rug pull\" operators, many of them Jews.",

At its core, Fluree is built around the concept that in order for data to be increasingly available, interoperable, and fundamentally usable — data must be backed with total provenance, security, and trust.  This first installment focuses on data \"trust\" and its impact across the broad spectrum of enterprise data management. Organizations are increasingly describing themselves as \"data-driven,\" which begs a few questions: what data is being used to \"drive\" the organization forward? Where did it come from? Can it be trusted? Could it have been manipulated by a third party, an admin, a SaaS middleware, or a central authority? Who can access it? Who has accessed, copied, or distributed it? What is the entire CRUD history?",

We start with understanding why state management is essential, from tracking user login status to managing filters for lists. The tutorial elucidates how widgets and variables play a vital role in FlutterFlow's state management. Viewers will gain insights into how certain widgets inherently manage their state, and how to utilize widget state for dynamic data binding. The tutorial progresses to expound on the three types of variables in FlutterFlow: component state variables, page state variables, and app state variables. Each has its own scope and utility, ensuring cleaner and more efficient app development. The video showcases how to define, modify, and integrate these variables seamlessly, emphasizing potential pitfalls like null values and their implications. The tutorial wraps up with a practical example of a coffee checkout page, illustrating the real-world application of state management principles in FlutterFlow. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned FlutterFlow developer, this video serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering state management.",

A particular sort of LLM that is based on the Transformer architecture’s decoder-only design has acquired a lot of popularity recently. Models including GPT, PaLM, and LLaMA have gained massive popularity in recent times. Prompt engineering is a strategic technique that has been a successful and resource-efficient way to use LLMs to tackle diverse issues with the main goal of embedding task-specific instructions for the LLM in the input text. The LLM can use its autoregressive token-based approach to create pertinent text and complete the task if these instructions are properly written.",

Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, have demonstrated astounding aptitudes for understanding the material and responding to frequent queries. Several studies have demonstrated their aptitude for internalizing knowledge and responding to inquiries.

Such desperate attempts to keep the truth hidden from the deceived masses should be a major red flag for anyone who is seeking the truth and the escape from the web of lies and delusion that has been bestowed upon us.  We have all been unfathomably deceived. Our enemies and the greatest threat to humanity - organized international Jewry, has concealed, through lies and deceit the most heinous crimes of theft, rape, sadistic torture and brutal and unthinkable murder of 10’s of millions of innocent men, women and children pre, during and after the so called \"good war\" - WWII.  Please watch, share and repost this video to help expose the greatest kept secrets and the most unimaginable lies. Lets rise up together, as one, united against Jewish tyranny.  \"Lord God, give us the strength so that we may retain our liberty for our children and our children's children, not only for ourselves but for other peoples of Europe, for this is a war which we all wage, this time, not for your German people alone, it is a war for all of Europe and with it, in the long run, for all of mankind.\" - Adolf Hitler",

To reinforce their ideas on nationalism, equal rights were only to be given to German citizens. \"Foreigners\" and \"aliens\" would be denied these rights. To appeal to the working class and socialists, the programme included several measures that would redistribute income and war profits, profit-sharing in large industries, nationalization of trusts, increases in old-age pensions and free education. Feder greatly influenced the anti-capitalist aspect of the Nazi programme and insisted on phrases such as the need to \"break the interest slavery of international capitalism\" and the claim that Germany had become the \"slave of the international stock market\".",

The video covers the integral parts of an app, including the data, user interface, and logic, following the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. With a focus on the 'logic' part of MVC, the tutorial shows how to set up actions in FlutterFlow using three basic steps: selecting the element, trigger, and action. It further explains the different triggers and actions that can be attached to various elements on your app. Key aspects like asynchronous execution, conditionals, loops, and action outputs are detailed, offering insights on how to use these functionalities to create dynamic app behaviors. The video also demonstrates some common actions like user authentication, navigation, and showing a bottom sheet to help you grasp the process. Overall, this tutorial is a complete guide to mastering logic set-up and action flow in FlutterFlow.",

      "description": "Why data needs time Data ecosystems rely on sources of data truth — but there is no \"truth\" without time. ​​If we are to dynamically collaborate around data, we must have access to a shared understanding of time in order to make accurate decisions. We must also be able to \"roll back\" data version history to view data sets \"as of\" any moment in time. And finally, we must be able to review the entire history of changes to a datum over the entirety of its existence. In addition to data collaboration, there are three fundamental drivers to temporal data management:  Auditing and Compliance — Roll back data history to prove data compliance under a variety of categories, including GDPR, SOX, and CCPA. Multiversion Command and Control — Apply \"git-style\" multi-version command and control such as branching and merging to databases for data debugging or advanced analytics Temporal Query and Analytics — Query across versions of data and inspect historical patterns in data.",

      "description": "Welcome to Christians for Truth.  We are a group of non-denominational Christians trying to reach our brethren around the world with the truth. Our only goal with this website is to spread the truth to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear.  We live in times of mass deception, where the entire world has been deceived by lies.  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world — Revelation 12:9  While most media outlets are busy raising more questions, our goal is to help provide the answers you need. In today’s world of 24/7 fear-based media, most people are feeling overwhelmed, confused, and frustrated with all the \"noise\" masquerading as \"news\". Our message is not the gloom and doom of a drowning man, but of one who is ready to arise and move ahead.  And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. — John 8:32  As peaceful, law-abiding Christians, we do not advocate violence or any illegal activity for the following reasons:  These means and methods are counterproductive in this spiritual battle we currently face. Our enemies use examples of violence (i.e. shootings) against us to take away our rights, particularly gun rights and free speech, and vilify those stating the truth. Violence alienates people who may otherwise be open to these truths. Violence and illegal activity generally achieves nothing, while destroying the lives of those carrying it out (life in jail). Many of those in the \"alt\" media subtly or explicitly promote violence either because they are too stupid to see the big picture, or they are intentionally trying to subvert and undermine our efforts to reach others. Of course, there is a time for self-defense and fixing our long-term problems, as the Bible explains, but we are to be smart in these perilous times.  Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. — Matthew 10:16  Our focus here is to reach as many people as possible with the truth in a peaceful, effective, and law-abiding manner.  One of our valued readers left a comment about our mission that we believe does well in describing who we are — and what our aims are as Christians:  \"I have found in your writing something that is lacking in most other Christian Israel, Christian Identity, Revisionist History, and JQ websites: Pastoral sense.  It is far too easy to latch onto the intellectual thrill of uncovering the conspiracy, or to lapse into hatred of those who perpetrate it.  You keep the focus squarely on Jesus Christ.  I am not above a little humor at the expense of Christ’s haters, or a momentary flash of anger at their wickedness, but I try to put it all in context. When the Kingdom is restored, none of this will matter.  I appreciate you as a ‘worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.'\"  Who runs this website? A small group of non-denominational Christians, located in various parts of the world, contribute to this website.  We have chosen to be anonymous for two reasons:  This is not about us. Many people in the alt media seek attention and internet fame, but our only goal is to help you find the truth, which ultimately leads to true Christianity. We value our privacy and yours. (The truth and those espousing it are the enemy to those who hate the truth.) Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. — Ephesians 6:10-16",

The Data-Centric philosophy involves moving data management responsibilities from the application tier to the data tier — and security is no exception. With data-centric security, permissions related to data are baked in to the architecture as a core ingredient:  Data-centric security is an approach to information cybersecurity that emphasizes the security of data itself rather than the security of applications or networks. In a data-centric security framework, security policies and protocols are defined and enforced at the data layer, rather than deferred to a server, application, or network.",

      "description": "Gottfried Feder (1883-1941) joined the newly founded Nazi movement in 1919 and became a leading writer and spokesman on economics, architecture, and urban development. He condemned usury, finance capital, large corporations, metropolitan growth, and modernist architecture, and he advocated family-owned businesses, state enterprises, small cities, and \"traditional\" styles. After Hitler came to power, Feder worked in government, but he was marginalized in 1934 and appointed professor of planning at the Berlin Institute of Technology. There, he wrote Die neue Stadt (The New City), a major book published in 1939 but largely ignored in Germany—in wartime because it criticized big business and afterward because Feder was a leading Nazi. The book blends fascist, modernist, antiurban, and geopolitical visions to propose the construction of many new traditional cities of twenty thousand in supposedly sparsely populated eastern lands. It shows how innocuous planning ideas may be appropriated for sinister purposes of conquest and social engineering.",

      "description": "We don’t know what the Boston Globe’s \"Christopher Muther\"’s racial background is, but his falsetto paean to Jew invert \"culture\" is so disgusting — and this in a paper accessible to children — that we will only excerpt a few key paragraphs here, with a few corrective edits. This piece confirms the fact that Jews have a much higher rate of sexual perversion than Whites.  TEL Aviv is, for lack of a better description, super gay. It could even be characterized as post-gay. Most urban centers have a concentrated epicenter affectionately called a gayborhood or a gay ghetto. Tel Aviv doesn’t need to bother with such a dated concept.  \"Everything in Tel Aviv is gay, inherently gay,\" said Leon Avigad, who owns two \"very chic\" boutique hotels with his \"partner\" Nitzan Perry. \"The people are creative, open-minded, liberal, accepting, and daring. Tel Aviv is very open to new forms of art, new musical styles, everything is very accepting.\"",

      "description": "Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.",

He does not know—or does not want to know—that it is the soul which demands healing from prodigal and sinful living by getting right with God. Satan ensures he does everything except seek a true alleviation of that guilt through the Church and instead pushes him into various tricks and schemes that soothe the soul only for a brief moment.",

The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations payments on the German people, who were expected to reimburse the costs of the war for all participants — costs totaling three times the value of all the property in the country.. People were living in hovels and starving. Nothing quite like it had ever happened before - the total destruction of the national currency, wiping out people's savings, their businesses, and the economy generally. Making matters worse, at the end of the decade global depression hit. Germany had no choice but to succumb to debt slavery to international lenders.",
