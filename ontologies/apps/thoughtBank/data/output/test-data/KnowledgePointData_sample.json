        "schema:description": "Open banking — where traditional banks open up their data with APIs to build new financial services for their customers — has the potential to be one of the payment world’s big disruptors: get it to work right, and it could supplant giant networks (and network fees) like Visa’s when it comes to taking and making payments wherever you might be. Today, a startup out of Berlin called Ivy, which has built an API to create a \"network of networks\" for open banking payments globally, is announcing some funding in its bid to make that a reality.",
