The goal is to use VIDYA to accomplish several vital tasks to further that effort. First, it will serve as a cross-game currency and inventory system that will enable developers to build multiple linked games that feature item sharing and other cross-connected gameplay mechanics.

Both no- and low-code solutions could help alleviate the global developer shortage.
