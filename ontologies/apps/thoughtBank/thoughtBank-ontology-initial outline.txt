same schema that we used in neo4j:


Resource
  name
  description
  sourceType
  sourceName
  resourceDate  (when was this published, made, etc.?)
  url
  rating (1-5)
  createdBy  (who added this resource to the db?)
  defaultImageUrl
  defaultImageData
  [{Image Collection}]  (a collection of our image class: id, resource_id, url, sort, remarks)
  [{Remarks Collection}]   (this could be a thread of comments)
  [{Tag Collection}]   (this is how we create links or edges between nodes)
  [{RelatedResource Collection}]   (linked to other resources)
  createdTimeStamp
Tag
 name
