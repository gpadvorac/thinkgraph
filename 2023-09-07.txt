1)  Review Ontology.  Best Practices?

2)  Show "Create Ledger" and defaults

3)  Show Insert

4)  Show Insert with "@type": "kp:KnowledgePointTag"

5)  What things use the ontology to enforce rules and shapes?

6)  Ask about Flakes in Fluree3 and Json-LD.  Haven't seen any mention of it.

7)  Query questions, may move to emial.

if this is my IRI:
"http://thinkgraph.org/ontologies/apps/thoughtbank/knowledgepointtag#"

all lower case makes it hard to read, especially with the doubel t (tt). it is OK to use a hyphen like this?
"http://thinkgraph.org/ontologies/apps/thoughtbank/knowledgepoint-tag#"


you replaced:
"@type": "kp:KnowledgePoint",

with:
"rdfs:Class": "kp:KnowledgePoint",




FYI, this is what the data looks like:



Another way to ask this is:

We want to filter on and array of values using variations of 'AND' and 'OR' logic.






When I click on a green node, it loads the tags.  good.  
When I click on it again, it loads the same tags again.  
We need a property on the node or somewhere so we know it has loaded tags already - so we can prevent loading them again.



Load a graph and left click to rotate.
Right click on the screen to pan.  
Now left click to rotate.  The rotate behavior is changing and is acting a little like the right click behavior.
Now right click to pan
Now left click to rotate again.

The more we right click, left click, etc. the more the behaviors merge to be the same.

maybe we need to clear some cache or something.




Once we get things working good, it might be nice to implement this feature:
